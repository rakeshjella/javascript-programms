🍪 1. Cookies
🔹 What it is:
============================
Small pieces of data stored in the browser.

Automatically sent to the server with every HTTP request.

Mainly used for authentication, user sessions, etc.

🔹 Features:
=================================
Max size: ~4KB

Can have expiry

Accessible from document.cookie

Used in both client and server

🔹 Example:

document.cookie = "username=Rakesh; expires=Fri, 20 Apr 2025 12:00:00 UTC; path=/";


💾 2. localStorage
=======================================
🔹 What it is:
Stores data in key-value pairs.

Persists even after browser/tab is closed.

Synchronous & fast for small data.

🔹 Features:
Max size: ~5–10MB

String-only storage

Not sent to server automatically

🔹 Example:

localStorage.setItem("name", "Rakesh");
console.log(localStorage.getItem("name")); // "Rakesh"


🕒 3. sessionStorage
============================================================================================
🔹 What it is:
Similar to localStorage, but lasts only for the session (i.e., until the tab or window is closed).

🔹 Features:
Max size: ~5MB

Tab-specific (not shared across tabs)

Also synchronous

🔹 Example:

sessionStorage.setItem("token", "abc123");
console.log(sessionStorage.getItem("token")); // "abc123"


🗃️ 4. IndexedDB
==================================================
🔹 What it is:
A low-level NoSQL database in the browser.

Used for storing large, structured data (like files, objects).

Asynchronous and powerful.

🔹 Features:
Max size: Hundreds of MBs to GBs (browser-dependent)

Complex data (objects, blobs)

Ideal for offline apps, caching

🔹 Example (simple usage):
let request = indexedDB.open("MyDatabase", 1);

request.onsuccess = function(event) {
  let db = event.target.result;
  console.log("DB opened successfully");
};
